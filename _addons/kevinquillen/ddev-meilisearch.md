## About this add-on

[Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) is a flexible and powerful user-focused search engine that can 
be added to any website or application.

This DDEV add on adds Meilisearch as a local service.

## Installation

With DDEV installed:

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```sh
ddev add-on get kevinquillen/ddev-meilisearch
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```sh
ddev get kevinquillen/ddev-meilisearch
```

## Configuration

The Meilisearch container is reached at hostname: "meilisearch", port: 7700.

Outside the container, you can visit `127.0.0.1:7700/health` in your browser to verify health status.

The default API key for Meilisearch is `ddev`. You can provide your own by 
adding to `.ddev/.env` in your project, and adding the `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` variable:

`MEILI_MASTER_KEY=my_master_key_value`

## Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is useful to navigate your collections and debug your 
search.

You can access the admin dashboard by navigating to this URL in your browser:

`https://(DDEV_HOSTNAME):7701`

To login provide the configured API key.

# Drupal and Search API

If you are using Drupal, you can use Search API and the [Search API 
Meilisearch](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_meilisearch) 
modules to connect to the running Meilisearch instance.
