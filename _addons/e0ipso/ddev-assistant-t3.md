# DDEV Assistant T3

## Overview

This add-on installs [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) in the DDEV `web` container and adds a `ddev t3 start` command that runs `t3 serve` in the foreground.

T3 is exposed through the active DDEV project hostname:

- `http://<project>.ddev.site:<http-port>`
- `https://<project>.ddev.site:<https-port>`

The default ports are calculated from the DDEV project name so multiple projects usually get different port pairs without manual coordination.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get e0ipso/ddev-assistant-t3
ddev restart
```

After installation, make sure to commit the `.ddev` directory to version control.

## Usage

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ddev t3 start` | Start `t3 serve` in the web container and stream logs |
| `ddev t3 help` | Show command help |

`ddev t3 start` prints the HTTP and HTTPS URLs before starting T3. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop T3.

Those URLs only work on the machine running DDEV. To reach T3 from another machine, see [Remote access](#remote-access-tailscale-lan).

This add-on does not install or validate assistant provider CLIs such as Claude, Codex, Gemini, Grok, OpenCode, or Cursor Agent. Install those separately in the `web` container when needed.

## Remote access (Tailscale, LAN)

Two things get in the way of a request arriving from a Tailscale peer or another host on
the LAN:

1. `ddev-router` binds its host ports to `localhost` unless the global
   [`router_bind_all_interfaces`](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/configuration/config/#router_bind_all_interfaces)
   setting is enabled.
2. `ddev-router` routes by `Host` header. It only answers to the project hostnames, so a
   request for `http://laptop.tailnet.ts.net:20500` gets a 404 even once the port is
   reachable.

T3 itself is not the problem: it already binds `0.0.0.0` inside the web container.

`ASSISTANT_T3_DIRECT_BIND_ADDRESS` publishes the T3 port straight from the web container
to one or more host addresses, skipping `ddev-router` and its hostname matching. It takes
a comma-separated list, and each entry becomes its own host binding on the same port. It
defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so out of the box T3 is also available at
`http://127.0.0.1:<direct-port>` and nothing is published beyond the machine.

Add the machine's Tailscale IP, from `tailscale ip -4`, to reach T3 from the tailnet:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.assistant-t3 --assistant-t3-direct-bind-address=127.0.0.1,100.91.141.70
ddev add-on get e0ipso/ddev-assistant-t3
ddev restart
```

Local browsers keep using `http://127.0.0.1:<direct-port>` and tailnet peers use
`http://100.91.141.70:<direct-port>`, with nothing exposed to any other network. Setting
the value to `0.0.0.0` publishes on every interface instead, and setting it to nothing at
all leaves only the `ddev-router` ports.

`ddev t3 start` then prints the direct address alongside the project URLs. The direct
port defaults to `10000 + offset`, using the same offset as the router ports, and can be
overridden with `--assistant-t3-direct-port`.

Installation fails with an explanation if the list repeats an address, or if it mixes
`0.0.0.0` or `[::]` with a specific one; both cases would otherwise leave the web
container unable to bind its ports and take `ddev start` down with it.

To turn remote access off again, clear the value and re-run the add-on; the generated
`.ddev/docker-compose.assistant-t3.yaml` is removed.

### Choosing bind addresses

| Value | Reachable from | If Tailscale is not running |
| ----- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `127.0.0.1` (default) | The DDEV machine only | Unaffected |
| `127.0.0.1,<tailscale-ip>` | The DDEV machine and the tailnet | `ddev start` fails until the address exists or the entry is removed |
| `0.0.0.0` | The DDEV machine, the tailnet, and every other network the machine is on | Unaffected |

Docker binds published ports when the container starts and fails if the address is not on
the host, so listing a Tailscale IP ties `ddev start` to `tailscaled` running:

```text
Error response from daemon: failed to bind host port for 100.91.141.70:16060:
cannot assign requested address
```

The whole project fails to start, not just T3. The address itself is stable, and it is
present whenever `tailscaled` is running, including while the machine is offline. Only
stopping the daemon removes it. If that happens, drop the entry from
`ASSISTANT_T3_DIRECT_BIND_ADDRESS`, re-run the add-on, and `ddev start` again. `0.0.0.0`
avoids the coupling entirely, at the price of publishing T3 on every attached network.

The direct port is plain HTTP. Traffic across the tailnet is still encrypted by
WireGuard, but browsers withhold some APIs outside a secure context, and the port carries
no TLS for LAN clients.

### Security

T3 drives assistant CLIs that execute code in the web container and it has no
authentication of its own. Anyone who can reach the direct port controls those assistants
and, through them, the project. Prefer listing the specific addresses you need over
`0.0.0.0`, which also publishes T3 on coffee-shop Wi-Fi and every other attached network,
and leave remote access off when it is not needed.

## Advanced Customization

Configuration lives in these files:

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `.ddev/.env.assistant-t3` | T3 version and port overrides |
| `.ddev/config.assistant-t3.yaml` | Generated DDEV web port exposure |
| `.ddev/docker-compose.assistant-t3.yaml` | Generated direct host port publishing, only when remote access is enabled |
| `.ddev/t3/settings.json` | T3 server settings, using T3's settings schema |

T3 runtime state is stored outside the project `.ddev` directory in DDEV's global cache. The add-on links T3's runtime `settings.json` back to `.ddev/t3/settings.json` so the user-editable server settings remain safe to commit.

To override the exposed ports or installed T3 version:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.assistant-t3 --assistant-t3-http-port=21000
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.assistant-t3 --assistant-t3-https-port=21001
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.assistant-t3 --assistant-t3-version=0.0.27
ddev add-on get e0ipso/ddev-assistant-t3
ddev restart
```

Port and version changes are rendered into generated DDEV files during `ddev add-on get`, so re-run the add-on installation and restart after editing `.ddev/.env.assistant-t3`.

All customization options (use with caution):

| Variable | Flag | Default |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_VERSION` | `--assistant-t3-version` | `latest` |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_HTTP_PORT` | `--assistant-t3-http-port` | Calculated from `DDEV_SITENAME` |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_HTTPS_PORT` | `--assistant-t3-https-port` | Calculated from `DDEV_SITENAME` |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_CONTAINER_PORT` | `--assistant-t3-container-port` | `3773` |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_DIRECT_BIND_ADDRESS` | `--assistant-t3-direct-bind-address` | `127.0.0.1`. Comma-separated list of host addresses; empty publishes nothing |
| `ASSISTANT_T3_DIRECT_PORT` | `--assistant-t3-direct-port` | Calculated from `DDEV_SITENAME` |

The default port pair uses this algorithm:

```bash
hash="$(printf '%s' "${DDEV_SITENAME}" | cksum | awk '{print $1}')"
offset="$(( (hash % 4500) * 2 ))"
http_port="$(( 20000 + offset ))"
https_port="$(( http_port + 1 ))"
```

Hash collisions are possible. Override the ports if two projects calculate the same pair.
