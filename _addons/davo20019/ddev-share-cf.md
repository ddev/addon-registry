## What is this?

This DDEV addon provides a simple command to share your local DDEV sites publicly using [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). It works similarly to `ddev share` (which uses ngrok) but with Cloudflare's free tunnel service.

## Features

- üöÄ **One command** - Just run `ddev share-cf` and get a public URL
- üÜì **Completely free** - No rate limits, no paid plans needed
- üîí **Secure** - No need to open ports on your firewall
- ‚ö° **Fast** - Powered by Cloudflare's global network
- üéØ **Zero configuration** - No account or API tokens required
- üíª **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows/WSL2

## Requirements

- DDEV v1.21.0 or higher
- `cloudflared` binary installed on your host machine
- macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2

**Important for Windows users:** This addon requires WSL2. You must install and run DDEV in WSL2, not natively on Windows. See the [WSL2 section](#windows-with-wsl2) below for details.

## Installation

### 1. Install cloudflared

First, install `cloudflared` on your host machine:

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.rpm -o cloudflared.rpm
sudo rpm -i cloudflared.rpm
```

**Windows with WSL2:**

> **Important:** This addon requires WSL2. WSL2 is your "host" environment where both DDEV and cloudflared must be installed.

If you're using DDEV with WSL2 (the recommended approach for Windows), follow the Linux instructions above **inside your WSL2 terminal**. For example, if using Ubuntu in WSL2:

```bash
# Run this inside your WSL2 terminal (not PowerShell or CMD)
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

**Do NOT install cloudflared on Windows itself** - it needs to be installed in WSL2 where DDEV runs.

For other installation methods, see the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

### 2. Install the DDEV addon

```bash
ddev add-on get davo20019/ddev-share-cf
```

## Usage

From your DDEV project directory, simply run:

```bash
ddev share-cf
```

This will:
1. Check if `cloudflared` is installed (shows installation instructions if not)
2. Start a Cloudflare Tunnel
3. Display a public URL you can share (like `https://randomly-generated.trycloudflare.com`)

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the tunnel when you're done.

## How It Works

When you run `ddev share-cf`, the addon:

1. Verifies `cloudflared` is installed on your host machine
2. Creates a temporary Cloudflare Tunnel pointing to your DDEV site
3. Routes public traffic through Cloudflare's network to your local DDEV site
4. No Cloudflare account or configuration required

The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command (similar to `ddev share`).

## Comparison with `ddev share`

| Feature | `ddev share` (ngrok) | `ddev share-cf` (Cloudflare) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Free tier** | 40 connections/min | Unlimited |
| **Speed** | Good | Excellent (Cloudflare CDN) |
| **Account required** | Yes | No |
| **Setup** | Configure token | Zero config |
| **URL persistence** | Changes each time | Changes each time |

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- üë• Client demos and previews
- ü™ù Testing webhooks from external services
- üì± Mobile device testing
- ü§ù Remote team collaboration
- üéì Teaching and presentations

## Troubleshooting

### Windows/WSL2: cloudflared not found

If you're using Windows with WSL2 and getting a "cloudflared not found" error:

1. **Verify you're in WSL2**: Open your WSL2 terminal (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) - not PowerShell or CMD
2. **Install cloudflared in WSL2**: Follow the Linux installation instructions in your WSL2 terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```
3. **Run all DDEV commands in WSL2**: Both `ddev` and `ddev share-cf` must be run from your WSL2 terminal

**Common mistake:** Installing cloudflared on Windows (via winget or PowerShell) instead of in WSL2. Remember: WSL2 is your "host" environment, not Windows.

### cloudflared not found (macOS/Linux)

If you get an error that `cloudflared` is not installed, the command will automatically detect your operating system and show you the appropriate installation instructions.

You can also manually install cloudflared by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section above.

### Command not found after installation

Make sure the addon is properly installed:
```bash
ddev add-on get davo20019/ddev-share-cf
```

### Permission denied error

The script should be executable, but if you encounter issues:
```bash
chmod +x .ddev/commands/host/share-cf
```

### Project not running

Make sure your DDEV project is running before starting the tunnel:
```bash
ddev start
ddev share-cf
```

### Drupal Multisite Configuration

The addon **automatically detects** Drupal multisite setups by checking for `sites/sites.php`. When detected, it adjusts the tunnel configuration to properly support multisite routing.

To use with **Drupal multisite**:

1. Run `ddev share-cf` - it will detect multisite and display: `‚ÑπÔ∏è Drupal multisite detected`
2. Note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
3. Add the mapping to your `web/sites/sites.php`:

```php
<?php
// Map the Cloudflare tunnel URL to your subsite
$sites['random-name.trycloudflare.com'] = 'stage';  // Replace 'stage' with your subsite directory name
```

4. The tunnel will now correctly route to your subsite

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to update `sites.php` with the new URL for each session.

### WordPress URL Redirects

The addon **automatically detects** WordPress installations. WordPress stores site URLs in the database, which can cause redirects (like after login) to redirect back to your local domain instead of staying on the tunnel URL.

When WordPress is detected, the addon will display instructions. To fix redirects:

1. Run `ddev share-cf` and note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
2. Update WordPress URLs using WP-CLI:

```bash
# Update to tunnel URL
ddev wp option update home 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com'
ddev wp option update siteurl 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com'
```

3. When done, revert back to local URLs:

```bash
# Revert to local domain
ddev wp option update home 'https://yoursite.ddev.site'
ddev wp option update siteurl 'https://yoursite.ddev.site'
```

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to update the URLs for each session. Alternatively, consider using the [Relative URL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/relative-url/) plugin for easier multi-domain support.

### Magento Base URL Redirects

The addon **automatically detects** Magento installations. Like WordPress, Magento stores base URLs in the database (`core_config_data` table), which causes redirects (like admin login) to redirect back to your local domain.

When Magento is detected, the addon will display instructions. To fix redirects:

1. Run `ddev share-cf` and note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
2. Update Magento base URLs:

```bash
# Update to tunnel URL (include trailing slash)
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/unsecure/base_url 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com/'
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/secure/base_url 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com/'
ddev exec bin/magento cache:flush
```

3. When done, revert back to local URLs:

```bash
# Revert to local domain
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/unsecure/base_url 'https://yoursite.ddev.site/'
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/secure/base_url 'https://yoursite.ddev.site/'
ddev exec bin/magento cache:flush
```

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to update the base URLs for each session.
