## What is this?

This DDEV addon provides a simple command to share your local DDEV sites publicly using [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). It works similarly to `ddev share` (which uses ngrok) but with Cloudflare's free tunnel service.

## Features

- 🚀 **One command** - Just run `ddev share-cf` and get a public URL
- 🆓 **Completely free** - No rate limits, no paid plans needed
- 🔒 **Secure** - No need to open ports on your firewall
- ⚡ **Fast** - Powered by Cloudflare's global network
- 🎯 **Zero configuration** - No account or API tokens required for quick tunnels
- 🔗 **Stable URLs** - Optional named tunnels for persistent custom-domain URLs
- 💻 **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows/WSL2

## Requirements

- DDEV v1.21.0 or higher
- `cloudflared` binary installed on your host machine
- macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2

**Important for Windows users:** This addon requires WSL2. You must install and run DDEV in WSL2, not natively on Windows. See the [WSL2 section](#windows-with-wsl2) below for details.

## Installation

### 1. Install cloudflared

First, install `cloudflared` on your host machine:

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.rpm -o cloudflared.rpm
sudo rpm -i cloudflared.rpm
```

**Windows with WSL2:**

> **Important:** This addon requires WSL2. WSL2 is your "host" environment where both DDEV and cloudflared must be installed.

If you're using DDEV with WSL2 (the recommended approach for Windows), follow the Linux instructions above **inside your WSL2 terminal**. For example, if using Ubuntu in WSL2:

```bash
# Run this inside your WSL2 terminal (not PowerShell or CMD)
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

**Do NOT install cloudflared on Windows itself** - it needs to be installed in WSL2 where DDEV runs.

For other installation methods, see the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

### 2. Install the DDEV addon

```bash
ddev add-on get davo20019/ddev-share-cf
```

## Usage

From your DDEV project directory, simply run:

```bash
ddev share-cf
```

This will:
1. Check if `cloudflared` is installed (shows installation instructions if not)
2. Start a Cloudflare Tunnel
3. Display a public URL you can share (like `https://randomly-generated.trycloudflare.com`)

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the tunnel when you're done.

## How It Works

When you run `ddev share-cf`, the addon:

1. Verifies `cloudflared` is installed on your host machine
2. Creates a temporary Cloudflare Tunnel pointing to your DDEV site
3. Routes public traffic through Cloudflare's network to your local DDEV site
4. No Cloudflare account or configuration required

The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command (similar to `ddev share`).

## Comparison with `ddev share`

| Feature | `ddev share` (ngrok) | `ddev share-cf` (Cloudflare) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Free tier** | 40 connections/min | Unlimited |
| **Speed** | Good | Excellent (Cloudflare CDN) |
| **Account required** | Yes | No |
| **Setup** | Configure token | Zero config |
| **URL persistence** | Changes each time | Changes each time (or stable with named tunnels) |

## Named Tunnels (Stable URLs)

By default, `ddev share-cf` creates a temporary quick tunnel with a random URL that changes each time. If you need a **stable, persistent URL** on your own domain, you can use **named tunnels**.

### Requirements for named tunnels

- A free [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- **A domain with its nameservers pointed to Cloudflare** — This is required because the `cloudflared tunnel login` command asks you to select a zone (domain) from your account. If you don't have any domains in Cloudflare, you won't be able to complete the authentication step and cannot use named tunnels. You can [add a domain to Cloudflare for free](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).

> **Don't have a domain in Cloudflare?** No problem — quick tunnels (`ddev share-cf` with no flags) work without any account or domain. Named tunnels are only needed if you want a stable URL on your own domain.

### Setup (one-time)

#### 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
ddev share-cf --login
```

This opens your browser to authorize `cloudflared` with your Cloudflare account. A certificate is saved to `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`.

#### 2. Create a tunnel and DNS route

```bash
ddev share-cf --create-tunnel my-project --hostname dev.example.com
```

This creates a named tunnel and adds a CNAME record on your Cloudflare domain pointing to the tunnel. DNS propagation may take a few minutes.

You can also create the tunnel without a hostname and add DNS later:

```bash
ddev share-cf --create-tunnel my-project
```

### Daily usage

Once set up, start the tunnel with:

```bash
ddev share-cf --tunnel my-project
```

Your site will be available at `https://dev.example.com` (or whatever hostname you configured) every time.

### Cleanup

To delete a named tunnel:

```bash
ddev share-cf --delete-tunnel my-project
```

> **Note:** This deletes the tunnel from Cloudflare but does not remove the DNS record. You can remove CNAME records from the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

### Named tunnels vs quick tunnels

| | Quick tunnel | Named tunnel |
|---|---|---|
| **URL** | Random `*.trycloudflare.com` | Your own domain |
| **Persistence** | Changes each time | Stable across sessions |
| **Account** | Not required | Cloudflare account + domain |
| **Setup** | None | One-time login + create |
| **Best for** | Quick demos, testing | Webhooks, client previews, CI |

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- 👥 Client demos and previews
- 🪝 Testing webhooks from external services
- 📱 Mobile device testing
- 🤝 Remote team collaboration
- 🎓 Teaching and presentations

## Troubleshooting

### Windows/WSL2: cloudflared not found

If you're using Windows with WSL2 and getting a "cloudflared not found" error:

1. **Verify you're in WSL2**: Open your WSL2 terminal (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) - not PowerShell or CMD
2. **Install cloudflared in WSL2**: Follow the Linux installation instructions in your WSL2 terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```
3. **Run all DDEV commands in WSL2**: Both `ddev` and `ddev share-cf` must be run from your WSL2 terminal

**Common mistake:** Installing cloudflared on Windows (via winget or PowerShell) instead of in WSL2. Remember: WSL2 is your "host" environment, not Windows.

### cloudflared not found (macOS/Linux)

If you get an error that `cloudflared` is not installed, the command will automatically detect your operating system and show you the appropriate installation instructions.

You can also manually install cloudflared by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section above.

### Command not found after installation

Make sure the addon is properly installed:
```bash
ddev add-on get davo20019/ddev-share-cf
```

### Permission denied error

The script should be executable, but if you encounter issues:
```bash
chmod +x .ddev/commands/host/share-cf
```

### Project not running

Make sure your DDEV project is running before starting the tunnel:
```bash
ddev start
ddev share-cf
```

### Drupal Multisite Configuration

The addon **automatically detects** Drupal multisite setups by checking for `sites/sites.php`. When detected, it adjusts the tunnel configuration to properly support multisite routing.

To use with **Drupal multisite**:

1. Run `ddev share-cf` - it will detect multisite and display: `ℹ️ Drupal multisite detected`
2. Note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
3. Add the mapping to your `web/sites/sites.php`:

```php
<?php
// Map the Cloudflare tunnel URL to your subsite
$sites['random-name.trycloudflare.com'] = 'stage';  // Replace 'stage' with your subsite directory name
```

4. The tunnel will now correctly route to your subsite

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to update `sites.php` with the new URL for each session.

### WordPress URL Redirects

The addon **automatically detects** WordPress installations. WordPress stores absolute URLs throughout the database (options, post content, meta fields, serialized data, etc.), which causes redirects, broken media, and broken links when accessing the site through a tunnel URL.

When WordPress is detected, the addon will display instructions. To fix this, use `wp search-replace` to replace URLs across all tables (including serialized data):

1. Run `ddev share-cf` and note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
2. Replace all URLs in the database:

```bash
# Replace local URL with tunnel URL (handles serialized data correctly)
ddev wp search-replace 'https://yoursite.ddev.site' 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com' --all-tables
```

3. When done, revert back to local URLs:

```bash
# Revert to local domain
ddev wp search-replace 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com' 'https://yoursite.ddev.site' --all-tables
```

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to repeat this for each session.

### Magento Base URL Redirects

The addon **automatically detects** Magento installations. Like WordPress, Magento stores base URLs in the database (`core_config_data` table), which causes redirects (like admin login) to redirect back to your local domain.

When Magento is detected, the addon will display instructions. To fix redirects:

1. Run `ddev share-cf` and note the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`)
2. Update Magento base URLs:

```bash
# Update to tunnel URL (include trailing slash)
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/unsecure/base_url 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com/'
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/secure/base_url 'https://random-name.trycloudflare.com/'
ddev exec bin/magento cache:flush
```

3. When done, revert back to local URLs:

```bash
# Revert to local domain
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/unsecure/base_url 'https://yoursite.ddev.site/'
ddev exec bin/magento config:set web/secure/base_url 'https://yoursite.ddev.site/'
ddev exec bin/magento cache:flush
```

**Note:** The tunnel URL changes each time you run the command, so you'll need to update the base URLs for each session.
